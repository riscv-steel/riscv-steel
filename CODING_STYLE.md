## RISC-V Steel Verilog Style Guide

### Introduction

Verilog-2001 is the main design language for RISC-V Steel IP.

Verilog can be written in vastly different styles, which can lead to code
conflicts and code review latency.

This style guide aims to promote Verilog readability for RISC-V Steel IP. The goals are to:

*   promote consistency
*   promote best practices
*   increase code sharing and re-use

This style guide defines style for Verilog-2001 code, both synthesizable and test bench code.

### Basic style elements

* Use Verilog-2001 conventions, files named as module.v, one file per module
* Only ASCII, **100** chars per line, **no** tabs, **two** spaces per indent for all paired keywords.
* C++ style comments `//`
* For multiple items on a line, **one** space must separate the comma and the next character
* Include **whitespace** around keywords and binary operators
* **No** space between case item and colon, function/task/macro call and open parenthesis
* Line wraps should indent by **four** spaces
* `begin` must be on the same line as the preceding keyword and end the line
* `end` must start a new line

### Naming conventions

* Use **lower\_snake\_case** for instance names, signals, declarations, variables, types
* Use **ALL\_CAPS** for parameters, enumerated values, constants and define macros
* Main clock signal is named `clock`. All clock signals must start with `clock_`
* Reset signals are **active-low** and **synchronous**, default name is `reset_n`
* Signal names should be descriptive and be consistent throughout the hierarchy. Avoid abbreviations

### Suffixes for signals and types

* Do **not** add suffixes like `_i`, `_o` or `_io` to indicate the direction of module ports
* Active low signals should use `_n`

### Language features

* Use **full port declaration style** for modules, any clock and reset declared first
* Use **named parameters** for instantiation, all declared ports must be present, do **not** use `.*`
* Top-level parameters is preferred over `` `define`` globals
* Use **symbolically named constants** instead of raw numbers
* Local constants should be declared `localparam`
* Sequential logic must use **non-blocking** assignments
* Combinational blocks must use **blocking** assignments
* Use of latches is strongly discouraged, use flip-flops when possible
* The use of `X` assignments in RTL is strongly discouraged
* Prefer `assign` statements wherever practical.
* Always define a `default` case
* When printing use `0b` and `0x` as a prefix for binary and hex. Use `_` for clarity, e.g. `0x0000_0000`
* Use logical constructs (i.e `||`) for logical comparison, bit-wise (i.e `|`) for data comparison
* Bit vectors and packed arrays must be little-endian, unpacked arrays must be big-endian
* FSMs: **no logic** except for reset should be performed in the process for the state register

## RISC-V Steel C Style Guide

### Introduction

C is the primary language used in software development for RISC-V Steel IP.

Like Verilog, C code can be written in vastly different styles, which can lead to code
conflicts and code review latency.

This style guide aims to promote readability for RISC-V Steel software source code. The goals are to:

*   promote consistency
*   promote best practices
*   increase code sharing and re-use

### Basic style elements

* All source code must be clang-formatted
* The `.clang-format` file with the style definitions can be found in the root folder of RISC-V Steel repository

### Naming conventions

* Use **lower\_snake\_case** for variables, functions and arguments
* Use **UpperCamelCase** for structs
* Use **ALL\_CAPS** for enums, constants, register addresses and compiler macros
* Names should be descriptive and be consistent. Avoid abbreviations
