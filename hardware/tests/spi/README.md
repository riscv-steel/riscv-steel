# SPI Controller IP Tests

This directory contains tests to verify the correct functioning of the SPI Controller. The tests are divided into hardware and software unit tests.

## How do I run the tests?

### Software Unit Tests

The software unit tests consist of an instance of RISC-V Steel MCU that runs the test program `software/unit_tests.c`. They verify the correct functioning of the API calls used to control the SPI module. This instance of RISC-V Steel MCU was built in Vivado and is meant to be run on an Arty-A7 development board.

* Open **AMD Xilinx Vivado**
* Click on **Run Tcl script...** in the **Tools** menu
* Select the file `software/arty_a7/create_unit_tests_project.tcl` and click **Ok**

    A Vivado project to run the unit tests will be created.

* Open a PySerial terminal by running `python -m serial.tools.miniterm`
* Generate the bitstream and program the FPGA
* The tests will start running. A successful run ends with the following message:

```
Passed all SPI Controller Software Unit Tests.
```

### Hardware Unit Tests

The hardware unit tests consist of a Verilog testbench. Follow the steps below to run the testbench on Vivado:

* Open **AMD Xilinx Vivado**
* Click on **Run Tcl script...** in the **Tools** menu
* Select the file `hardware/create_unit_tests_project.tcl` and click **Ok**

    A Vivado project to run the unit tests will be created.

* To run the unit tests type `launch_simulation; run -all` in Vivado **Tcl Console** and press Enter.
