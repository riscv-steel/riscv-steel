Reads are requested by pipeline stage 2 and provide data from one or two registers. Writes are requested by stage 3 and put the data coming from the Writeback Multiplexer into the selected register. If stage 3 requests to write to a register being read by stage 2, the data to be written is immediately forwarded to stage 2. Each operation is driven by a distinct set of signals, shown in the tables 5 and 6, below. Table 5. Integer Register File signals for read Signal name Width Direction Description RS_1_ADDR 5 bits Input Register source 1 address . The data is placed at RS_1 immediately after an address change.

Branch Unit The Branch Unit ( branch_unit.v ) decides if a branch instruction must be taken or not. It receives two operands from the Integer Register File and, based on the value of opcode and funct3 instruction fields, decides the branch. Jump instructions are interpreted as branches that must always be taken. Internally, the unit realizes just two comparisions, deriving other four from them. Table 7 (below) shows the module input and output signals. Table 7.

Load Unit The Load Unit ( load_unit.v ) reads the DATA_IN input signal and forms a 32-bit value based on the load instruction type (encoded in the funct3 field). The formed value (placed on OUTPUT ) can then be written in the Integer Register File. The module input and output signals are shown in table 8. The value of OUTPUT is formed as shown in table 9.

LOAD_UNSIGNED Effect on OUTPUT 1'b0 The remaining bits of OUTPUT are filled with the sign bit. 1'b1 The remaining bits of OUTPUT are filled with zeros. Store Unit The Store Unit ( store_unit.v ) drives the signals that interface with memory. It places the data to be written (which can be a byte, halfword or word) in the right position in DATA_OUT and sets the value of WR_MASK in an appropriate way. Table 10 (below) shows the unit input and output signals. Table 10.

This project files are stored at soc/vivado and, of course, you need Vivado installed on your machine and an Arty A7-35T board to run this project. The system is formed by Steel + RAM + UART interface. The UART interface was designed to have 9600 baud rate, 1 stop bit, no parity and no control. Example system built with Steel Note that the RAM and the UART share the processor interface to read/write data. A bus arbiter is used to multiplex this interface signals according to the address the core wants to access. In this example, the address 0x00010000 is used to access the UART transmitter. The address 0x00020000 is used to access the UART receiver. RAM addresses start at 0x00000000 and end at 0x00001fff. All other addresses are invalid. A program compiled to run with this project is stored at the software directory. The program sends the string \"Hello World, Steel!\" through the UART transmitter. If you have an Arty A7-35T board and Vivado you can run the project following these instructions: Run Vivado and open the project (the file named example_soc.xpr at soc/vivado folder) Connect the board to your computer using a USB cable Find the name that your system gave to the board USB-UART interface. In Windows it should be something like COMX, and in Linux systems something like /dev/ttyUSBX (X is a number given by the OS) Download a program to emulate a serial terminal, like PuTTY (available for Windows and Linux systems) Configure a serial connection for the USB-UART interface to 9600 baud rate, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity and no control Open the serial terminal after configuration Generate the bitstream and program the board in Vivado After that you should see this message on the terminal:","title":"Example system"},{"location":"getting/","text":"A microprocessor by itself does not form a computer system, so you need to connect Steel to memory and peripherals to build a system that can do work for you.

They can be connected to a single device or to an interrupt controller managing interrupt requests from several devices. If your system does not need interrupts you must hardwire these signals to zero. The real-time counter interface provides a 64-bit bus to read the value from a real-time counter and update the internal time register. If your system does not need hardware timers, you must hardwire this signal to zero. To learn about how the core communicates with the devices mentioned above, read the section Timing diagrams .

In the figure, mem[addrX] denotes the data stored at the memory position addrX .
